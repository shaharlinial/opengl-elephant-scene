# Elephant in porcelain shop scene
This is a C++ program that uses OpenGL 1.1 to simulate an elephant in a porcelain shop scene.

The program provides a scene engine that allows for camera rotations, translations, light attribute changes, perspective transformations, and other interactive features to be applied to the scene.

In this program, the user can explore this concept by manipulating the camera and observing the behavior of the elephant and the porcelain objects in the scene. This program is a fun and educational way to learn about computer graphics, OpenGL 1.1. It can be used for entertainment, education, or as a base for more complex scene simulations.
